# Overview:
A research about detecting earnings management behavior of managements using Modified Beneished model
### Research aim(s): 
The most important purpose of this study is to identify and measure current levels of earnings management of listed companies in Vietnam Stock market.
### Research Importance/Contribution: 
This research provides the latest statistics on levels of earnings management in listed companies in Vietnam stock market. In addition, this study also gives some recommendations and solutions to earnings management problem in Vietnam.
### Objectives: 
In this study, discretionary accruals are the main objectives that will be researched and measured.
### Scope: 
The research collects data from 180 listed companies in Vietnam stock market in 2016.
### Methods: 
The study uses Modified Jones Model (1995) to identify how high the level of earnings management of companies is, illustrated by **Discretionary Accruals**
\Total Accruals_t = \Net Income_t - \CFO_t
\Discretionary Accruals_t = \Total Accruals_t - \Non-Discretionary Accruals_t
And the non-discretionary accruals can be calculated with the next formula
\begin{equation}
    \frac{NDA_t}{TA_{t-1}} = \beta_1 \frac{1}{A_{t-1}} + \beta_2 \frac{(\Delta REV_t - \Delta REC_t)}{A_{t-1}} + \beta_3 \frac{PPE_t}{A_{t-1}}
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    DA_t = \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}
The estimates of  \beta_1,\beta_2, \beta_3  and non-discretionary accruals during the estimation period are obtained from the original Jones model. The Jones model totally admit that discretion is not exercised over revenue in either the estimation period or the event period. The modified version implicitly assumes that all changes in credit sales in the event period result from earnings management. Because it seems to be easier to manage earnings by exercise discretion over the recognition of revenue on credit sales than on cash sales.

### Limitation: 
Due to the data available constraints, the data is mainly derived from formal and creditable financial websites (website of VNDIRECT securities corporation, website of Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange, Hanoi stock exchange).
